# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.
NOTE: You need to download Node.js if you're going to run this program without VS code (which i did in my video)
1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code (or 2 terminals of cmd, run all of them as administrator to avoid any technical issues)
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
